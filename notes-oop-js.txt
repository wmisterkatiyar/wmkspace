objects are 
key : value
pairs set. 

value => can be => a variable/property or function/method or even another object reference.

obj.key is undefined by default

delete obj.key // deletes key

** use STRICT MODE always.

function is, by default, called in reference of its associated object so it gets the value of "this". "this" is a **reference** to current object. but we can bind or call the function for other objects too.

obj1  = { val1: 45, method1: function(){return this.val1;} }
obj2  = { val1: 56 }
obj1.method1() // 45

** now we can call the method in reference to other object. **

obj1.method1.call(obj2); //**56**
